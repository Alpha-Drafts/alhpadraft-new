/**
 * @description
 * This file defines the environment types and the corresponding URLs for each environment (local, development, staging, production).
 *
 * @example
 * const envUrl = getEnvUrl();
 * alert(envUrl);  // Output: https://example.com (depending on environment)
 *
 * So if the environment is set to "development", and the `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEVELOPMENT_URL` is "https://dev.example.com", it will alert "https://dev.example.com".
 *
 * Useful for dynamically setting API endpoints or other environment-specific configurations in a Next.js application.
 *
 * This utility function helps in managing different environments without hardcoding URLs in the application.
